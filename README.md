# Psychic-Game

This is game to see if you can guess the letter that the computer has guessed.
It will take input from the user for 9 tries if the user does not guess the letter before that.
If you can't guess the letter in 9 tries, the game will reset and update the losses by 1.
If you do guess the letter the game will automatically reset and show 1 more win regardless if you still have tries left.
